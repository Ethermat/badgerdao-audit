# BadgerDAO Crowd Audit

The objective is to bring together NexusMutual community members in order to perform a crowd audit to assess the security of BadgerDAO's smart contracts.

*This repo is used as a MVP to understand if a collaborative audit approach is possible.*

## Methodology and Summary

The audit should consist of different parts, which can be performed independently and without any specific order:

| Topic        | Results |
| ------------- |:---------------:|
| Evaluation of 3rd party audits #5  |        |
| Architecture analysis #6 |   |
| Software development processes #7 |   |
| [Static code analysis](static_code_analysis.md) | No high findings confirmed. |
| Dynamic code analysis #2 |   |
| Source code review #4 |   |

Performed checks should at least cover common best practices such as:
 * [Smart Contract Weakness Classification and Test Cases](https://swcregistry.io/)
 * [Smart Contract Best Practices](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/)

**Major vulnerabilities should be directly communicated with the Badger team instead of being discussed in public. Please follow the responsible disclosure approach.**
